# Description

Small quiz game that starts when you click the button. A timer starts from 60 seconds and you are presented with your first question. Once you answer the question a new question will be displayed at random from a pool of questions. 

If you get a question right your score will go up by one point (which is displayed at the end of the quiz). If you get a question wrong the timer will go down by 10 seconds and your score will not go up. The answer buttons will change color to reveal whether they were correct or incorrect upon choosing. The timer will turn red once there are 10 seconds or less remaining, and at 1 second the game will be over, which removes the answer choices and gives the player the option to start the quiz over from the start.

When all the questions are answered your time is increased to 10 minutes and you are offered a button that will take you to the high score page, where you can save your initials/name and score. You can save your most recent score locally, however if you clear your score then your results/name will be cleared from the page and your locally stored score will be set to zero.
